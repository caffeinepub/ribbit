        "On the Lily page, the left edge of the pond avatar aligns with the left edge of the title/description text, image/link block, and engagement/action row (i.e., no additional horizontal offset caused by a side-by-side avatar/content layout).",
        "The page remains a single readable column within the existing max width container (no unintended horizontal scrolling on mobile or desktop).",
        "All existing Lily page functionality remains intact (view count increment, like/unlike, share, bookmark, ribbit creation, lightbox modal)."
