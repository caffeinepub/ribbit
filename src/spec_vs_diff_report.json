  "summary": "The diff does not provide visible evidence (due to truncation and lack of shown JSX/layout changes) that the Lily page header layout was updated to align the pond avatar metadata block with the main content column while keeping the back button offset. Only non-source-of-truth summary/state files clearly reflect the intent.",

      "requirement": "Update the Lily detail page header layout (frontend/src/pages/LilyPage.tsx) so the pond avatar metadata block aligns to the same left edge as the lily title/description/image/link/actions, while keeping the back button offset to the left/in front of that aligned column (Reddit-style), without overlap and scoped to Lily page only.",
      "reason": "The provided LilyPage.tsx diff is truncated before any header/layout JSX changes are shown, so there is no concrete evidence in the diff summary that the required alignment/back-button-offset layout change was implemented.",
