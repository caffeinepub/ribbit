  "summary": "FrogProfilePage adds a leftmost Back button with history-based navigation and fallback to '/', addressing placement and behavior. However, the Back control appears icon-only (no visible \"Back\" text), so it does not fully match the Lily page Back button styling requirement (icon + label). Also, non-requested meta/state files were modified.",

      "reason": "The Back button in FrogProfilePage renders only an ArrowLeft icon with an aria-label; there is no visible “Back” label text shown alongside the icon, which is explicitly required.",
