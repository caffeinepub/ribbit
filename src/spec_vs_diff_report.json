  "summary": "The diff summary does not include any visible implementation of the requested LilyPage header layout changes, pond-avatar swap, or the lily-vs-ribbits divider. It also shows edits to metadata/state summary files that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update LilyPage header layout: avatar on left; two-line metadata with pond name in bold + \"•\" + relative timestamp on line 1; username non-bold on line 2; preserve pond link navigation.",
      "reason": "The provided LilyPage.tsx diff excerpt only shows imports, hooks, and view-count logic; it contains no evidence of the header JSX/layout being updated or the \"•\" separator/two-line typography/link preservation.",

      "requirement": "Use pond avatar (pond profile image) in LilyPage header with fallback (e.g., 🐸); do not use user avatar in the header avatar slot.",
      "reason": "While LilyPage imports Avatar components and fetches pond data via useGetPond, the diff excerpt does not show any JSX wiring AvatarImage to pond profile image nor any fallback behavior, and thus cannot confirm the avatar source was changed away from user avatar.",

      "reason": "The diff excerpt is truncated before rendering sections and contains no evidence of a new divider element or Tailwind border classes between lily content/engagement and the Ribbits section.",
