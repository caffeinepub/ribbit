  "summary": "The diff largely implements the requested Reddit-style pond layout: PondPage shows Feed/About tabs on mobile only and introduces a new PondAboutSidebar for the right column on desktop; PondAboutPage makes the tabs mobile-only as well. One potential gap is that PondPage’s loading and “pond not found” desktop right column still renders the generic RightSidebar rather than pond-specific About content.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "At viewport width >= `lg`, the right column on PondPage shows pond-specific About content (not Trending Ponds / Popular Tags / Hot This Week).",
      "reason": "In PondPage, the desktop right column renders the generic <RightSidebar /> in at least the loading and not-found branches, so the right column is not consistently pond-specific at `lg` and up.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/PondPage.tsx (loading state renders <RightSidebar /> in right aside)",
        "frontend/src/pages/PondPage.tsx (not-found state renders <RightSidebar /> in right aside)"

      "description": "Added a desktop-only “Back to Feed” button on the Pond About page.",
      "reason": "REQ-4 only asks to remove the Feed/About tabs on desktop and avoid redundant desktop-only navigation; it does not request adding new navigation controls.",
