  "summary": "REQ-1 and most of REQ-2 appear implemented via a new MobileLeftSidebarDrawer component and a mobile-only hamburger button in Header. RightSidebar received new outer container styling consistent with a light-gray rounded panel. However, the hamburger behavior does not strictly \"toggle\" (it only opens), and there are unrelated changes (not requested) including modifications to the Internet Identity hook and added project metadata files.",

      "reason": "The hamburger handler in Layout only sets the drawer state to open (true). There is no evidence the hamburger click will close the drawer when already open; closing appears to rely on scrim click or route change.",
