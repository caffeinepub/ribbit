  "summary": "REQ-4 appears implemented by simplifying the Tag detail page UI so the visible header block contains only the tag icon/name, lily count, sort tabs, and lily list, with no visible “Total Activity” or “Last Activity” fields in the provided snippet. REQ-5 appears implemented by making the global header fully opaque via an opaque `bg-background` class and no visible backdrop-blur styling in the header container.",
