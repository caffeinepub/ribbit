    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "On mobile (lg:hidden) in frontend/src/pages/PondAboutPage.tsx, when the user is not a member, a Join Pond button is displayed in the same section where the Leave Pond button is displayed for members (membership controls section).",
      "reason": "PondAboutPage.tsx shows new join/leave handlers and membership detection, but the provided truncated diff does not include any JSX demonstrating a Join button rendered conditionally for non-members, its placement in the membership controls section, or that it is mobile-only via responsive classes like lg:hidden.",

      "requirement": "On mobile in PondAboutPage, when the user is a member, the existing Leave Pond button behavior remains unchanged (including loading/disabled state).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a new leave handler and mutations, but the truncated content does not show the Leave button JSX or confirm that its existing loading/disabled behavior is preserved.",

      "reason": "No diff content is shown for frontend/src/components/PondAboutSidebar.tsx, and the truncated PondAboutPage.tsx does not show whether any desktop-visible Join control was added or modified.",
