  "summary": "The diff does not provide clear evidence that the Lily page layout was updated to left-align all sections in a single column. Instead, the visible LilyPage.tsx changes focus on view count increment behavior (cooldown/StrictMode guard) and project metadata tracking updates, which are outside the requested layout-only change.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Lily page layout (frontend/src/pages/LilyPage.tsx) so the pond avatar, metadata/title/description, image/link block, and engagement/action buttons are all left-aligned in a single column with no extra left indentation between these sections.",
      "reason": "In the provided (truncated) LilyPage.tsx diff, the visible changes relate to view-count increment guarding and image aspect ratio handling; there is no visible evidence of JSX/CSS/className changes that would change the avatar/content layout to a single left-aligned column with consistent left edge alignment across sections.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/LilyPage.tsx (truncated diff shows logic changes, no visible layout/className adjustments)"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added view-count increment cooldown/StrictMode duplicate-call guard logic (tracking attempted increments via ref; checking cooldown; recording successful increments).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is explicitly limited to a Lily page alignment/layout correction with no new features. The diff shows new behavioral logic around view counting that goes beyond layout/alignment.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/LilyPage.tsx (useRef viewIncrementAttemptedRef; isWithinCooldown/recordViewIncrement; incrementViewCount onSuccess/onError)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Updated/added project tracking entries describing new feature requests (AR-1, AR-2) and marking them pending in project_state.json.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for changes to project_state.json or addition of feature-tracking records; it only requests a layout fix in LilyPage.tsx under strict non-goals (no new features).",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json (new_feature_requests includes AR-1/AR-2 with status \"pending\")"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Repository-wide documentation/summary file updated with unrelated feature descriptions (e.g., TagHubPage route at `/tags`, header changes, etc.).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is scoped to Lily page alignment only and explicitly says no redesign of other pages/components. Updating a broad frontend summary file with unrelated features is not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions TagHubPage `/tags`, Header/Create dropdown, various page redesign details)"
