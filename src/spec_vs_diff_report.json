  "summary": "The diff does not show any implemented layout/alignment changes for LilyPage. Instead, LilyPage.tsx adds view count increment logic (with cooldown guarding) and related query/mutation hooks, which goes beyond the requested UI-only alignment update.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the LilyPage layout so the lily title, description text, image block, and engagement/action buttons row are all flush to the left with no extra left gap/indentation.",
      "reason": "No evidence in the provided LilyPage.tsx diff snippet of layout/className/structure changes affecting left alignment of the title, description, image, or engagement/action buttons row. The shown changes focus on view count logic and image aspect ratio loading, not layout alignment.",

      "description": "Increment lily view count on page open with cooldown guard, including tracking attempted increments and recording successful increments.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly scopes this as a UI-only alignment update and states no changes to backend behavior, data fetching, or mutations are required. Adding a view-count increment mutation changes runtime behavior beyond alignment.",
