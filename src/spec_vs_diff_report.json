  "summary": "The diff summary does not provide visible evidence that the Back button was repositioned within the Lily header row or that the change was scoped only to LilyPage. The only clearly evidenced changes are updates to project metadata/summaries, which were not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update `frontend/src/pages/LilyPage.tsx` so the existing Reddit-style Back button is positioned immediately to the left of the pond avatar within the lily header row (and not rendered as a separate block above the content), keeping existing `handleBackClick` behavior and accessibility.",
      "reason": "The provided `LilyPage.tsx` diff is truncated and does not show any Back button JSX/layout changes or placement relative to the pond avatar; no evidence confirms removal of the prior separate Back button block or its relocation into the header row.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not include any changes (or explicit non-changes) to `FrogProfilePage.tsx`, and does not provide sufficient evidence that the Back button UI was not introduced/modified on the frog profile page as part of this fix.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: only shows modified files `frontend/src/pages/LilyPage.tsx`, `frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`; no mention of `frontend/src/pages/FrogProfilePage.tsx`"
