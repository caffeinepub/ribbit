The diff shows an added migration module and a backend import/wiring for migration, plus a project_state.json update—none of which directly demonstrate changes to the pond creation flow or membership updates.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Update the backend pond creation flow so that the pond creator is automatically added as a member of the pond at creation time, including updating Pond.members, memberCount, and the creator profile joinedPonds without duplicates, while preserving existing createPond behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff summary for backend/main.mo is truncated and does not include any createPond implementation changes or any logic that adds the creator to Pond.members, sets memberCount to at least 1 on creation, or updates the creator’s profile joinedPonds.
