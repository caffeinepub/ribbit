  "summary": "Diff shows HomePage and TagPage tabs markup without obvious bottom-margin utility classes on the tabs container/wrapper. However, due to truncation, PondPage and TagHubPage changes cannot be confirmed from the provided excerpts, so full REQ-1 compliance is not verifiable.",

      "requirement": "PondPage: the Tabs container no longer applies bottom-margin utility classes (e.g., remove `mb-0 lg:mb-4` from the Tabs `className`).",
      "reason": "The PondPage diff is truncated before the desktop tabs section, and the shown excerpt does not include the relevant Tabs container/className to verify removal of bottom-margin classes.",

      "requirement": "TagHubPage: the tabs header wrapper no longer adds bottom margin below the tab buttons (e.g., remove `mb-4` from the `border-b ...` wrapper inside Tabs) so the content card starts immediately below the tab bar.",
