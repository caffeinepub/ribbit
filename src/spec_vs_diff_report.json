  "summary": "Diff adds a new RibbitMiniBlurAvatarImage component and wires it into RibbitItem and ProfileRibbitItem to show a blurred placeholder while avatar images load. However, the error/unavailable-avatar behavior appears to deviate from the requested existing fallback behavior (initials/placeholder), because on image load error it keeps the gray placeholder image rather than falling back to initials.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "If an avatar URL is missing/unavailable, the existing fallback behavior (initials/placeholder) continues to work and no broken image icon appears.",
      "reason": "When the avatar URL exists but the image fails to load, RibbitMiniBlurAvatarImage sets isLoaded true but keeps finalUrl as the MINI_BLUR_PLACEHOLDER, meaning the Avatar/Image continues to render a gray placeholder image instead of switching to the existing AvatarFallback initials behavior.",
