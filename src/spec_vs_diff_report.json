  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented via `rounded-full` classes on the Header search input and the All Ponds 'Start a Pond' button. Due to truncation of `Header.tsx` and `UserSettingsPage.tsx`, it is not possible to confirm that *all* Header buttons (REQ-2) and the three specific User Settings buttons (REQ-4) were updated. Two metadata/state files were modified without being requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update all buttons in the Header to use a fully-rounded (9999px) border radius (e.g., `rounded-full`) across desktop and mobile header layouts.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet shows some Header buttons updated with `rounded-full` (e.g., hamburger menu, 'All Ponds' link button, mobile search icon button, mobile plus icon button), but `Header.tsx` is truncated, so it cannot be verified that *all* button-style controls in `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx` were updated.",

      "requirement": "Update 'Save Changes', 'Save Froggy Phrase', and 'Choose Avatar' buttons on the User Settings page to use a fully-rounded (9999px) border radius (e.g., `rounded-full`).",
      "reason": "`UserSettingsPage.tsx` is truncated before any of the relevant button JSX is shown, so there is no direct diff evidence that these three specific buttons were updated to `rounded-full` (or that only these controls changed shape).",
