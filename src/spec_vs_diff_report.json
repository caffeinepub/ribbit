  "summary": "The diff summary does not show any changes to the pond creation or user membership logic in `backend/main.mo`; only a metadata/state file was updated. Based on the provided evidence, the requested backend fixes (REQ-1, REQ-2) are not implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the backend pond-creation logic so that when a new pond is created, only the creating principal (`caller`) is added as a member (and optionally as the initial moderator/admin per existing behavior), rather than adding all known/initialized users.",
      "reason": "No visible modifications to the `createPond(...)` logic or pond `members`/`memberCount` initialization are present in the diff summary; `backend/main.mo` content shown is type/variable definitions only and is truncated before any `createPond` implementation.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated)",
        "project_state.json (still lists REQ-1 as pending)"
      ]

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure pond creation updates user membership state only for the creating principal (e.g., the creator’s `UserProfile.joinedPonds`), and does not append the new pond to every user’s profile or any global joined-pond list for other principals.",
      "reason": "No visible changes show updates to user profile membership (`UserProfile.joinedPonds`) during pond creation being restricted to `caller`; `project_state.json` indicates the request remains pending.",
