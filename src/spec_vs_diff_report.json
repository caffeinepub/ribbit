  "summary": "A new `PondCardJoinControl` component was added and wired into `AllPondsPage.tsx` to show a Join/Joined button on each pond card and prevent Link navigation when clicking the control. However, the diff does not show any explicit refresh/invalidation of the joined-ponds query after a successful join, so membership status consistency after joining is not clearly implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the All Ponds page membership indicator stays consistent with the join action by refreshing the joined-ponds query state after a join from a pond card.",
      "reason": "The join success handler only shows a success toast and does not show any query invalidation/refetch of `useGetJoinedPonds` (or other cache update) to ensure the joined status updates on the card without a full refresh.",
