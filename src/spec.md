# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the extra left gap on the LilyPage by aligning the lily title, description, image block, and engagement/action buttons flush left.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust LilyPage layout/styles so the left edges of the title, description text, image block, and engagement/action buttons row align consistently with no extra left indentation.
- Ensure the alignment update preserves the avatar/metadata area layout and remains responsive on mobile and desktop without causing horizontal overflow.

**User-visible outcome:** On the LilyPage, the title, description, image, and action/engagement buttons line up flush to the left with the visible left gap removed.
