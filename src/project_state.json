    "Root cause hypothesis: pond creation is (directly or indirectly) initializing new pond `members` from a global list like `initializedUsers : [Principal]`, causing all known principals to be added to every newly created pond. Correct behavior is `members = [caller]` and `memberCount = 1`, with no other principals added on creation."
