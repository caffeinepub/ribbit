        "On viewports >= `lg`, hovering a lily card shows the hover background flush to the card's left and right edges (no horizontal inset).",

        "On viewports < `lg`, the hover background remains unchanged (still inset on all sides as it is currently).",
        "No other page/container/layout spacing is changed outside of the LilyCard hover background layer."

    "Changing overall desktop page/container padding or column widths on Home/Pond/Lily pages.",
    "Changing LilyCard content layout, typography, or interactions beyond the hover background inset."
