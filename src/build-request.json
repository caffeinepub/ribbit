        "When createPond is called successfully, the newly created Pond record includes the creator in Pond.members.",
        "The newly created Pond record has memberCount that reflects the creator’s membership (i.e., at least 1 on creation).",
        "The creator’s profile joinedPonds (phrase-hash based user profile storage) includes the newly created pond name immediately after creation.",
        "If the creator is already present in the pond membership list due to any edge case, the backend does not add a duplicate membership entry and does not double-increment memberCount.",
        "Existing createPond behavior (pond metadata, images, admin/moderator assignment, etc.) continues to work as before."

    "Changing the pond join/leave UI behavior or adding new UI screens.",
